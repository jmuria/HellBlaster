Sometimes you know that you shouldn't be where you are. You made wrong decissions and now you are walking on Hell.
Your Visual Studio solutions and projects use a lot of internal libraries that you or your team code and you use... 
Well.. It's hard but you have to be honest... You use file reference for them. A sigle change in one of the libraries 
imples that you have to navigate through all your solutions and projects and one by one changing the referente to the new one. 
You may have those libraries in one central storage or in a local mirror named R: or whatever but this does not help on that. 
Perhaps you have wandered about don't changing the library version so you don't need to change the references... That means
going deeper and deeper because that means that there is no past, just present. You cannot make any release branch and
hotfix to save any situation. 
Well.. I know what that Hell means and perhaps you are in the same situation. But even in the worst situation you need
a full powered weapon to let you survive while you find the way out. This is the purpose of this tool. This tools helps
to find all the file references in all the solutions and projects and let you update all of them in just a couple of clicks. 
Oh yeah ! That sounds good. 
Be my partner and walk on Hell with me with this weapon. Perhapts with this, the Hell is not so Hell as before.
